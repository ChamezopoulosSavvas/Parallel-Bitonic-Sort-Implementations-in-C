# Parallel-Bitonic-Sort-Implementations-in-C

This is a mini project developed for the ECCE Auth course - Parralel and Distrubuted Systems

It includes 5 different implementations of the Bitonic Sort Algorithm, where the input size is of type 2^n

Implementations:

Pthreads: Recursive
OpenMP:   Recursive && Imperative
CilkPlus: Recursive && Imperative
